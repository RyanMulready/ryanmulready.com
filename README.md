## Deployments with Vercel

The website is hosted on [Vercel](https://vercel.com), which provides an all-in-one platform to build, deploy, and scale your applications faster. To deploy the application for production, simply push your commits to the main branch. Vercel will automatically trigger a deployment once it detects the new commits.

To facilitate continuous integration, we have connected this GitHub repository to our Vercel project. Therefore, for every push to the repository, a new deployment is automatically initialized.

You can learn more about Vercel deployments [here](https://vercel.com/docs).
